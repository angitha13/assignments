	<a href="#top">GO TO TOP</a>
	<p>A computer is a general purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a set of arithmetic or logical operations. Since a sequence of operations can be readily changed, the computer can solve more than one kind of problem.</p>
	<h4 id="cpu">cpu</h4>
	<p>A central processing unit (CPU), also referred to as a central processor unit, is the hardware within the computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetical, logical, and input/output operatons of the system. The term has been in use in computer industry at least snce the early 1960s. The form, design and implementation of CPUs have changed over the course of their history, but their fundamental operation remains much the same.

	<h3 id="alu">ALU</h3>
	<p>In computing, an arithmetic and logical unit(ALU) is a digital circuit that performs integer arthmetc and logcl operations. The ALU is a fundamental building block of the central processing unit of a computer, and even the simplest microprocessor contain one for purposes such as maintaining timers. The processors found inside modern CPUs and graphics processing units(GPUs) accommodate very powerful and very complex ALUs: a single component may contan a number of ALUs.</p>
